# Description
Heart failure is a the most common event caused by Cardio Vascular Disease. Cardio Vascular Diseases are the number cause of death in the world. Machine learning can help to predict heart disease. Early detection is important for CVD management.

# Analytical insights
  We can see that people with a higher OldPeak have a higher chance of having heart disease

## A description of model solving busines problem -
## The KNN model score tells us that the features used in the model together account for 89 % of the variance in the target.

## Recommendations -  
## Patients - Our insights show that people who have a higher OldPeak are at risk of having heart disease and a management plan should be put in place to treat.

## Model Performance: I suggest that the model that should be used for this data is the KNN Model.
